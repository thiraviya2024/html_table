# 🌐 HTML Task  – Table with Course Links and Images

## 📄 Description

This task is part of my Web Development Workshop. In **Task 3**, I created a structured HTML table and enhanced it with additional functionality.

### 🧩 Key Features:
- Created an HTML table with the following columns:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Department
  - Course
- Added clickable **W3Schools links** inside the "Course" column using anchor (`<a>`) tags.
- Embedded **three images** below the table using `<img>` tags.
- Ensured all images are aligned and properly sized for a clean layout.

---
Below the table, three images are displayed in a neat layout.
